# whentodrive

This application is able to retrieve traffic fluency data from [Digitraffic].

## Maven build
Build should work out of the box with Java 1.7, just do `mvn compile` or `mvn test` to try it.

You need to provide your user information in `src/main/resources/conf.json`

â€“ just run the tests and [Configuration] will generate `conf-template.json` for you (which you can then rename).

[Configuration]: src/main/java/juhoautio/whentodrive/configuration/Configuration.java

### Intellij IDEA

Just import as a maven project. It might take a while to generate the sources. Be patient - it should work out of the box.

## TrafficWsClient
[TrafficWsClient] is a ws client that uses CXF generated classes
- See [pom.xml] for `cxf-codegen-plugin`
- See [TrafficWsClientTest] for usage example

[pom.xml]: pom.xml
[TrafficWsClient]: src/main/java/juhoautio/whentodrive/client/TrafficWsClient.java
[TrafficWsClientTest]: src/test/java/juhoautio/whentodrive/client/TrafficWsClientTest.java


## TrafficRsClient
[TrafficRsClient] is a ws.rs client that makes HTTP call.
- No dependency to CXF class generation
- See [TrafficRsClientTest] for usage example

[TrafficRsClient]: src/main/java/juhoautio/whentodrive/client/TrafficRsClient.java
[TrafficRsClientTest]: src/test/java/juhoautio/whentodrive/client/TrafficRsClientTest.java


## Troubleshooting

### Java 1.8

With Java 1.8, code generation may fail. With Java 8 it's still possible to use [TrafficRsClient]. Or even [TrafficWsClient], if the ws code is first generated with java 1.7 or 1.6.


### Code generation from WSDL

If code generation oddly fails, check that http://open.digitraffic.fi/services/trafficFluency?wsdl is returning to HTTP GET.
